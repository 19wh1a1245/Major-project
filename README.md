# Major-project
Flight planning is one of the challenges in Industrial world which faces many uncertain conditions. One such condition is delay occurrence, which stems from various factors and imposes considerable costs on airlines, operators, and travelers. Delay in departure can occur due to bad weather conditions, seasonal and holiday demands, airline policies, technical issue such as the problems in airport facilities, luggage handling and mechanical apparatus, and the accumulation of delay from the preceding flights. Here in the flight delay prediction system the delays are predicted based on the weather parameters. The system considers temperature, humidity, rain in mm, visibility and month number as the important parameter for prediction of delay. Moreover, the development of accurate prediction models for the flight delays became cumbersome due to the complexity of air transportation system, the number of methods for prediction, and the deluge of flight data. The initiatives used to address the flight delay prediction problem, according to scope, data and computational methods, giving par-ticular attention to an increased usage of machine learning methods. The designed prediction tasks contain different classification tasks and a regression task. The system also depicts the relationships between flight delay prediction problems and research trends to address them.
# Step by step procedure
1)Install VS Code 
<br>2)Downloading the Flight dataset from kaggle.
<br>3)Uploading the dataset in the project path
Data Preprocessing for the text dataset
Tokenizing the vocabulary and saving the tokenized files to pickle files
Converting the data to sequences of input data and sequences
Converting the class vector to binary class matrix
We then build our model using Random Forest
Training the model 
Testing the model 
We have even build UI using Flask where the user can interact
